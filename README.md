## User guide
This is an explanation on how to use the program:

Before starting make sure you point to the picture of the clock in the correct place. This program was coded in windows and the picture of the clock was pointed correctly for my computer.

1. When the program runs the clock image which is pointed to will pop up in a window and the **user has to click in the clock's center point**.
2. After the user has clicked the center point of the clock two new windows will appear which shows were the program predicts the clock hands are and the predicted time (the previous window of the clock will disappear).
